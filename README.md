# Tip_Calculator

I have completed one more project as named Tip Calculator, as named you can guess what is it about.

It contains simple ui design which contains
- Input field to enter an amount
- Radio button to rate the service
- One checked button to round the tip or not
- Finally the calculate button to calculate the tip in us dollars
- Atlast one textview to show the tip amount

-->>> Here is an example of how it works-

1. adding 25 as amount , choose service rating as good and round tip is selected , so the output you can see in picture

2. If you deselect the round tip , so output is given below

3. Now you are thinking if we clear the amount so it will generate the error, but wait i have taken care of that condition too,
